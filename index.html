                <p>The Connecticut state flag depicts a coat of arms with three grape vines thought to represent the three original colonies that would later form Connecticut.  The latin phrase "Qui transtulit sustinet" means "He who transplanted still sustains."</p>

                <h3>About Connecticut</h3>
                <p>Connecticut is a member of the United States of America.  It is best known for being located midway between New York City and Boston, as well as having excellent pizza and the famous UConn Huskies basketball teams.</p>
                <p>Additionally, although it is a small state, it features a tremendous number of state and national parks which residents enjoy hiking and picnicking.  As a member of New England, Connecticut is often among the states most visited by tourists in the Autumn to view the dramatic changing leaves.</p>
                <p>Connecticut is one of the 13 original colonies from the pre-revolution era, and one of the 6 states considered to be the region of "New England."  As such it enjoys a fairly moderate climate with summer highs generally in the 80s and 90s and winter lows generally in the 20s and 30s.</p>
                <p>The state is the 48th smallest state by land mass, but the 29th most populous state, which sheds light on it's population density.  While the state might conjure in peoples' minds its more rustic and rural parts, there is a great concentration of people along the I-95 corridor leading into New York City - a popular (and expensive) commuter's choice.  This is reflected in the population densities of the three most populous counties, drawing a straight line from New York City to Connecticut's capitol city of Hartford: Fairfield County, New Have County, and Hartford County.</p>
                <h4>Pizza:</h4>
                <p>New Haven, located on the southern coast of Connecticut at the mouth of the Housatonic river, is world famous for its pizza.  There are a number of individual companies competing for the title, however, of Best Pizza In The World.In this author's objective opinion, the three top contenders rank (indisputably) as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pepe's</li>
                    <li>Modern</li>
                    <li>Sally's</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Grand Apizza and Worcester Street Pizza are worthy honorable mentions.  Anyone desiring only the most delectable experience of cheese, sauce, and their favorite toppings on crispy-yet soft fire roasted bread ought to nowhere else but one of these fine establishments.  This can't be overstated: <em>Don't bother with any other pizza in the country.</em> If you live in San Francisco, this author apologizes that the nearest proper pizza place is some 3,000 miles away. </p>
